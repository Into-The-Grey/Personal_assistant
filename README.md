# Personal Assistant Project

This project harnesses the power of the Phi-2 model, a state-of-the-art language model with 2.7 billion parameters, designed for advanced text generation, comprehension, and interaction. Our aim is to explore its capabilities, from generating human-like text to understanding complex queries, and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI.
